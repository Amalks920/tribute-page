       <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
       <ul>
         <li><p><span class="bold">1873 </span>- born in Maida Vale</p></li>

          <li><p><span class="bold">1931 </span>- entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics</p></li>

           <li><p><span class="bold">1934 </span>- elected to a fellowship at King’s College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory.</p></li>

            <li><p><span class="bold"> 1938 </span>- went on to join the Government Code and Cypher School</p></li>

             <li><p><span class="bold"> 1945 </span>- recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London to create an electronic computer.</p></li>

             <li><p><span class="bold"> 1950 </span>-  Turing proposed what subsequently became known as the Turing test as a criterion for whether an artificial computer is thinking.</p></li>

              <li><p><span class="bold"> 1952 </span>-  convicted of “gross indecency”—that is to say, homosexuality, a crime in Britain at that time—and he was sentenced to 12 months of hormone “therapy.”</p></li>

              <li><p><span class="bold"> 1953 </span>- appointed to a specially created readership in the theory of computing</p></li>

              <li><p><span class="bold"> 1954 </span>- Turing was discovered dead in his bed, poisoned by cyanide.</p></li>
       </ul>
